# Wera screwdriver keeper (holder)

#### Attaches to OpenBeam Kossel Pro or OpenBeam extrusion

A mountable bracket that lets you hang onto those really
nice Wera drivers that came with your [OpenBeam Kossel Pro](http://kosselpro.com).

Use the inset screw holes to attach this to a horizontal rail
on your Kossel Pro with the included (in your Kossel kit)
M3 x 6mm BHCS screws and hex nuts.

The printed holes are currently one-size-fits-all.

### Print settings

My print settings for this part were:

* 0.2mm layer height
* 3 shells/perimeters
* .15 infill \*
* 4 layers solid (top, 3 with linear infill \**)
* 3 layers solid (bottom)


\* At 15% infill, the first solid layer may look ugly,
progressively getting better/flatter as the printer
makes multiple passes.

\*\* 4 layer top infill takes into account the amount of passes
it takes for a **triangle** based infill to be 'solid' on
my own printer. If you're using **linear**, set it to 3
and things should be okay.
