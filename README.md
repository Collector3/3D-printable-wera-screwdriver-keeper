# Wera screwdriver keeper (holder)

#### Attaches to OpenBeam Kossel Pro or OpenBeam extrusion

A mountable bracket that lets you hang onto those really
nice Wera drivers that came with your OpenBeam Kossel Pro.

Use the inset screw holes to attach this to a horizontal rail
on your Kossel Pro with the included (in your Kossel kit)
M3 x 6mm BHCS screws and hex nuts (that you meticulously
counted out and added onto each extrusion).

The printed holes are currently one-size-fits-all, which
is kind of what I want when working on my own printer.

### Print settings

My print settings for this part were:

* 0.2mm layer height
* 3 shells/perimeters
* 4 layers solid (top)
* 3 layers solid (bottom)
* .15 infill (linear)

At 15% infill, the first solid layer may look ugly,
progressively getting better/flatter as the printer
makes multiple passes.

You may be able to get away with
3 solid top layers depending on your infill pattern.
